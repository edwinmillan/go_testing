# Go Testing

This Project serves as a test bed for me to explore Go.

I am using it as a way to get familiar with Go using my experience in Python to help drive progress.

## Baseline Tests

### Requirements:
- 500,000 Unique IP Addresses must be generated randomly.
- Random IP Addresses should be written to a file.

### Initial Baseline

Go 1.11.1:
`go run generate_ip_list.go  7.39s user 0.42s system 166% cpu 4.690 total`

Python 3.7:
``python generate_ip_list.py  3.64s user 0.11s system 98% cpu 3.798 total`
